  This blog series chronicles IOS-XR's Journey to the web through a series of
  integrations with community tools. Open/R, open sourced by Facebook in 2017 
  is a great example of open source innovation driving the evolution of vendor
  network stacks to be more open and pluggable. In this blog, we understand the
  various integration points and expectations with Open/R and see how IOS-XR
  lives up to the task at hand, quite admirably.
